;; cleaned up, so you have to do this manually.  After ;, inserted
;; newline will not be deleted if you immediately type }, so you

;; Advisory only:
;; woman-mode sucks.  1) It is supposed to set buffer tab-width to woman-tab-width, but this
;; does not happen, so the width is totally screwed up.  (A better way would be to
;; expand tabs to spaces.)  2) Rereading manpath cache with `C-u M-x woman` does not work;
;; you have to quit emacs.  3) Sometimes it opens in the wrong frame.  4) It does not read
;; all manpages, for example OS X printf(3).

;; man mode is really slow, but formatting is correct.
;; newframe puts man page in new frame -- but new every time!  That's somewhat useless.
;; default tabs are 8 and untabify is called before man-mode-hook -- so we cannot set
;;   the tab-width.  Man-cooked-hook is called before, but Man-mode runs
;; (kill-all-local-variables) and undoes our changes to tab-width.

;; Speed can be increased a lot by not using -a switch.
