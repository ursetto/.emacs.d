NOTES on Emacs extensions              -*- org -*-

* Cscope

In xcscope.el.
Retrieved from <http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cscope/cscope/contrib/xcscope/>
Also put cscope-indexer from same location into ~/local/bin.  The module recommends this script.

If you do not use cscope-indexer, and you have files other than normally indexed by cscope,
you should create a "cscope.files" file with the names of all indexed files.
E.g. "echo *.c *.m *.h *.scm > cscope.files".  cscope automatically rebuilds the database
when needed, and these files will be wiped out otherwise.  To disable this behavior, 
(setq cscope-do-not-update-database t).  This will add "-d" to the cscope options.


* Paredit

Patched paredit-split-sexp to not delete horizontal space.

* term/ directory

Contains startup files for specific terminals.  For example, screen-256color.el enables
256 colors in TERM=screen-256color by loading the xterm 256 color code (this crap is
hardcoded in emacs).
